    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken wings</li>
        <li>Flour or cornstarch</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the chicken wings: Rinse the chicken wings under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels. Trim the tip of each wing and discard it. Then, separate the drumette from the flat and push the meat down towards the thicker end to create a lollipop shape. You can also remove the smaller bone and cartilage from the thin end if desired.
        </li>
        <li>Season the chicken wings: In a bowl, combine salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and any other desired spices or seasonings. Mix well. Season the chicken wings generously with the spice mixture, ensuring they're evenly coated. Let them marinate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to develop.
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the coating: In separate bowls, beat the eggs and place the flour or cornstarch. You can also add additional spices to the flour or cornstarch for extra flavor if desired.
        </li>
        <li>Coat the chicken wings: Dip each seasoned chicken wing first into the flour or cornstarch, shaking off any excess. Then, dip it into the beaten eggs, allowing any excess to drip off. Finally, coat it again in the flour or cornstarch, ensuring it's evenly coated. Place the coated chicken wings on a plate or wire rack.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the oil: In a deep fryer or large skillet, heat oil to 350-375째F (175-190째C). Make sure there's enough oil to fully submerge the chicken wings.
        </li>
        <li>Fry the chicken lollipops: Carefully place the coated chicken wings into the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry in batches if necessary. Fry the chicken wings for about 8-10 minutes, or until they're golden brown and crispy, and the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C).
        </li>
        <li>Drain and serve: Once cooked, remove the chicken lollipops from the oil using a slotted spoon and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil. Let them cool slightly before serving. Optionally, serve with your favorite sauce for dipping.
